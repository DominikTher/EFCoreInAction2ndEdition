# Entity Framework Core in Action, Second Edition

I'd like to share some code samples from the book [Entity Framework Core in Action, Second Edition](https://www.manning.com/books/entity-framework-core-in-action-second-edition). I'm incorporating best practices from the book into Clean Architecture to explore new approaches for managing dependencies across projects. Please note that these samples are not suitable for production-grade projects.

Notes
- Flattening
- Relational fixup
- Global Query Filters (with database first)
- Split Queries
- Value Conversions (with database first)
- Try all relationships, required, nullable, on-delete ...
